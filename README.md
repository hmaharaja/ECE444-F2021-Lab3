A non-functional requirement I would improve is the usability of the application. It doesn't specifically say that the user must enter something in 'search terms' for there to be any results or that I can put my discipline there, etc, and that took a few minutes to figure out on my own. I would specify these details somewhere on the page to make it easier for the user to navigate the application.

A functional requirement I would improve/add is to be able to restrict the searching by discipline. If I am an ECE who wants to take an area 6 (software) course, I don't need to see an MSE course that contains the term "software" in the description but doesn't actually teach anything related to software.
